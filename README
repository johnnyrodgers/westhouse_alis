== ALIS: Adaptive Living Interface System ==

This application is intended to be run on the local network of West House.  It provides a GUI for the control of the house systems (lights, climate control) and a prototype feedback system to monitor the energy footprint of the house and its occupants.

Documentation on the architecture and use of the application is available in /doc.
